Mutable Rules
=============

**201** Players shall alternate in clockwise order, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.  
In mail and computer games, players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**202** One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.  
In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

**203** A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**205** An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**206** When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

**207** Each player always has exactly one vote.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**208** The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.  
In mail and computer games, the winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**209** At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**210** Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule-changes unless they are team-mates.  
The first paragraph of this rule does not apply to games by mail or computer.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**211** If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.  
If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.  
If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**212** If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.  
When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.  
The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.  
Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.  
New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**213** If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.  
This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**302** A new proposal must be presented for discussion within 48 hours of the conclusion of the previous round; failure to do so will result in a 5-point penalty to the player whose turn it is, and the skipping of that player's turn.  
*Proposed by Peter on 1/5/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**303** We define a 'quorum' to be the minimum number of 'eligible voters' required for an action on a rule change to be accepted. It will currently be set to 2/3rds of the number of 'eligible voters', rounded up. Once a proposal has been presented, quorum must be reached within 36 hours. At the end of this time period, if 'quorum' has been reached and not all 'eligible voters' have voted, action may be taken as if the 'eligible voters' making up the 'quorum' represented all 'eligible voters', and 'Eligible voters' not in the 'quorum' will be penalized 2 points. If 'quorum' is not reached, the rule change is considered 'tabled' - no points are awarded or subtracted, and the rule number does not increment, but that players turn is ended.  
*Proposed by Richie on 1/10/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**306** Point trading is allowed. That is, two players may (in private or public) come to some agreement of services in exchange for points at any time (not just on one of their turns). The transfer occurs when one of the parties involved has emailed the group stating the amount being sent from whom and to whom, and the second party involved seconding the procedure.  
[*This rule will be amended to allow confidential trading of points as soon as a framework to allow it has been finished and approved.*]  
*Proposed by Peter on 1/17/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**307** There exists a map called the 'gameboard.' An up to date version of the 'gameboard' shall be kept with the rest of the Wumpusland documentation. The 'gameboard' contains at least two completely distinct areas; one labeled "Start," and one labeled "Finish." When any player lands on the 'Finish' area, no further play is possible. That player gets another turn. No player may move on the 'gameboard' until the rules of such movement are further clarified in future rules.  
*Proposed by Richie on 1/17/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**308** Repeal rule 204.  
*Proposed by Craig on 1/19/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**309** For a player to land on the start position of the game board they must
have a sufficient game piece that depicts a resemblance of them riding
a mythical creature.  To determine if this game piece is sufficient
anyone can call for a vote at any time by sharing their game piece
with everyone else in Wumpusland and a simple majority results in the
game piece being placed on the starting position.  
*Proposed by Shawn on 1/21/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**311** Positions on the gameboard are described by a 5-tuple of integers (positive or negative) - for example, (5,-1,4,0,0), (which for convenience can be written as a 3-tuple (5,1,4) when the last two numbers are both zero. The first 3 represent distance north of the origin, distance east of the origin, and height above the origin, each in units of wumplength. The fourth number represents time in the future ahead of the origin, in units of wumptime - where the origin is always at the current time. The fifth number represents distance from the origin along the wump axis, in units of wumpitude. The gameboard extends infinitely in all dimentions except for the 5th, in which it has a circular topology with (x,y,z,t,w) === (x,y,z,t,w modulo 3).  
The start area is centered at the origin (0,0,0,0,0) and the Wumpusland Warehouse where points can be exchanged for items is located at (2,10,0,0,0).  
*Proposed by Richie on 1/26/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**312** The game state cannot be modified except in any way explicitly stated by the rules. The game state currently includes: the number of points any player has, the rules, proposals or votes, positions on the game board, items on the game board, winners and losers of the game, points trades, or any motion or action involving the game board. As any actions are defined which players may do to affect the game, those actions are implicitly added to the "game state" (eg, should players be allowed to give their pieces unique powers, those powers will now be part of the game state and must be used in ways that are explicitly stated by the rules. Or, if players are allowed to craft items from points, those crafting actions will affect game state and thus have to be explicitly allowed by rules) However, if an action is taken that does not affect the game state in any way, it is still allowed even if no rule explicitly states it. (eg, if there is a unanimous vote that pete smells bad, unless smelling bad affects the game state in some way, it would be allowed)  
*Proposed by Craig on 1/28/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**313** The game board is envisioned as a physical space, and during play game pieces exist at a single point (x,y,z,t,w) on the board except while in transition from one location to another through a process yet to be defined. As in a physical space, such changes in frame require energy, or fuel. Fuel costs are proportional to the distance traveled, and  historical data indicate that unit price is proportional to the total amount of circulating currency [1]. Therefore, motion from one point on the board to another will cost a certain number of points determined by (a) distance from starting to ending point, and (b) the total number of points in play at the beginning of the turn.  
The travel distance is calculated as the spacetime interval between the starting point p1 (x1,y1,z1,t1,w1) and ending point p2 (x2,y2,z2,t2,w2), here using:
     s = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2 - (t2 - t1)^2 + (d(w1,w2))^2 ), 
where d(a,b) = displacement in the wump dimension.  
The cost c of travel is determined using s and the sum of all players' points, p:
     c = ceil( s * log_(phi) (s * gamma(p / 100 + phi) )
where ceil is the ceiling function, gamma is the (real) gamma function, the logarithm base is phi, and phi is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618.  
Points will be deducted at the completion of the turn involving the change of location. Players may not move to locations the motion to which would exceed in fuel costs their number of points. Fuel costs do not preclude the waging of other fees, taxes, etc., for travel to or from any location on the game board, or for any other reason.  
*Proposed by Andy on 1/31/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**314** Further members to Wumpusland must be approved by majority vote unless an exception applies.  All executions of exceptions must be reviewed by majority vote of Wumpusland members.  
Exception I. Proposed member is exempt if these conditions are met: (1) youtube video is posted of that proposed member eating a teaspoon of cinnamon (2) proposed member waxing of all pubic hair in the presence of a Jain (3) stealing of another Wupusland member's spoon.  
Exception II. Proposed member must have unanimous approval if that proposed member slept with a proposed member' friend's sister or a member's sister.  
*Proposed by Norman on 2/3/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**315** During your turn you may use a random number generator that gives a natural number with values ranging from 1 to 6. Your game piece teleports that many consecutive spaces along the game board from your location when you generated a random number when/if game spaces are defined.  Once using the random number generator it is not optional to teleport, but if multiple directions are possible you can choose which direction.  
To decide game spaces players may submit designs at any time so long as there is not currently a design being voted on.  Simple majority will result in the design being adopted.  Once an initial design has been accepted any future submissions must be given only during your turn (in addition to your rule) and the outcome of the vote on your rule will be the outcome of the amended game spaces.  
Keep in mind any submissions need to reflect the five dimensions that the board has already been ruled to have.

**316** We hereby define the time at the start of Round 1 as "0 AW" (After Wump). At the end of each round, the current time increments by one 'wumptime', also referred to as a 'year'. This time increments whether or not a proposal is actually given or if the round is skipped. So for example, Pete's turn was time "15 AW" and after his round was skipped the time currently is "16 AW." Time before the current time is denoted "T BW" (Before Wump), where here 'T' is the number of wumptimes or 'years' before the beginning of Round 1.   
The past of the game and thus the gameboard is defined as follows:  
The wumpusland universe and gameboard was created 6000 'years' before the start of the game (6000 BW). The finish area existed from the beginning of wumpus time. The start area and the wumpus warehouse were created in 0 AW. Once an object is created in wumpus time, it exists from that point up indefinitely into the future until another object or event changes or removes it. So for now the start area exists for any time T >= 0 AW. If an action occurs at time T, the effect immediately takes place in all times T' > T. So if a gamepiece is at time T' in the future, and the current proposal at time T < T' states "A fireball destroys the wumpus warehouse", the warehouse will immediately also be destroyed at time T' and that gamepiece in the future may no longer use it. When any new object or action is defined, if it's time of creation is not specified, it by default is assumed to be the current year.  
The guiding principle should be that you consider mostly only the effects on the gameboard and its associated objects, not the gamepiece or its associated objects, and do not propagate changes to "solve" paradoxes. In addition, gamepieces that are currently moved into the future or the past should usually not be effected. So for example, if I travel to the future and in 15 AW buy a hammer, but in 10 AW someone destroys the warehouse, my hammer still exists, but I shouldn't expect any other inhabitants of the future gameboard that I encounter to have purchased hammers since 10 AW.  
Note that these principles can be applied to things other than physical objects: if you replace "hammer" with "ninja skills" and "warehouse" with "ninja master" in the above example, it will still hold.  
On the other hand if I travel to 15 AW and build a castle at a point, and in 10 AW that point is turned into a swamp, I can expect my future castle to burn, fall over, and sink into the swamp.
