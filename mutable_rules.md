Mutable Rules
=============

**201** Players shall alternate in clockwise order, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.  
In mail and computer games, players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**202** One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.  
In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

**203** A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**205** An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**206** When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

**207** Each player always has exactly one vote.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**208** The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.  
In mail and computer games, the winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**210** Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule-changes unless they are team-mates.  
The first paragraph of this rule does not apply to games by mail or computer.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**211** If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.  
If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.  
If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**212** If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.  
When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.  
The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.  
Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.  
New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

**213** If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.  
This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.  
*Proposed by Initial Ruleset on N/A, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**302** A new proposal must be presented for discussion within 48 hours of the conclusion of the previous round; failure to do so will result in a 5-point penalty to the player whose turn it is, and the skipping of that player's turn.  
*Proposed by Peter on 1/5/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**303** We define a 'quorum' to be the minimum number of 'eligible voters' required for an action on a rule change to be accepted. It will currently be set to 2/3rds of the number of 'eligible voters', rounded up. Once a proposal has been presented, quorum must be reached within 36 hours. At the end of this time period, if 'quorum' has been reached and not all 'eligible voters' have voted, action may be taken as if the 'eligible voters' making up the 'quorum' represented all 'eligible voters', and 'Eligible voters' not in the 'quorum' will be penalized 2 points. If 'quorum' is not reached, the rule change is considered 'tabled' - no points are awarded or subtracted, and the rule number does not increment, but that players turn is ended.  
*Proposed by Richie on 1/10/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**304** Rule 209 (At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rule.) is repealed until rule 301 is no longer in effect.  
*Proposed by Craig on 1/11/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**306** Point trading is allowed. That is, two players may (in private or public) come to some agreement of services in exchange for points at any time (not just on one of their turns). The transfer occurs when one of the parties involved has emailed the group stating the amount being sent from whom and to whom, and the second party involved seconding the procedure.  
[*This rule will be amended to allow confidential trading of points as soon as a framework to allow it has been finished and approved.*]  
*Proposed by Peter on 1/17/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**307** There exists a map called the 'gameboard.' An up to date version of the 'gameboard' shall be kept with the rest of the Wumpusland documentation. The 'gameboard' contains at least two completely distinct areas; one labeled "Start," and one labeled "Finish." When any player lands on the 'Finish' area, no further play is possible. That player gets another turn. No player may move on the 'gameboard' until the rules of such movement are further clarified in future rules.  
*Proposed by Richie on 1/17/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**308** Repeal rule 204.  
*Proposed by Craig on 1/19/12, last amended by N/A on N/A*

**309** For a player to land on the start position of the game board they must
have a sufficient game piece that depicts a resemblance of them riding
a mythical creature.  To determine if this game piece is sufficient
anyone can call for a vote at any time by sharing their game piece
with everyone else in Wumpusland and a simple majority results in the
game piece being placed on the starting position.
