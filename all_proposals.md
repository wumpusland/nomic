All Proposals
=============

**301** *Shawn Bartok* - **PASSED**  
Immutable rules are now mutable except for rule 101. (this will allow us to change to majority voting instead of unanimous asap)  
- *yes* - Shawn, Richie, Peter, Craig  
- *no* -  

**302** *Peter* - **PASSED**  
A new proposal must be presented for discussion within 48 hours of the conclusion of the previous round; failure to do so will result in a 5-point penalty to the player whose turn it is, and the skipping of that player's turn.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**303** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
We define a 'quorum' to be the minimum number of 'eligible voters' required for an action on a rule change to be accepted. It will currently be set to 2/3rds of the number of 'eligible voters', rounded up. Once a proposal has been presented, quorum must be reached within 36 hours. At the end of this time period, if 'quorum' has been reached and not all 'eligible voters' have voted, action may be taken as if the 'eligible voters' making up the 'quorum' represented all 'eligible voters', and 'Eligible voters' not in the 'quorum' will be penalized 2 points. If 'quorum' is not reached, the rule change is considered 'tabled' - no points are awarded or subtracted, and the rule number does not increment, but that players turn is ended.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**304** *Craig* - **PASSED**  
Rule 209 (At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rule.) is repealed until rule 301 is no longer in effect.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**305** *Shawn* - **FAILED**  
In order for a rule change or new rule to be voted into existence it simply requires 2/3 majority with the person proposing the rule counting as a vote (instead of the previous 100% support).  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie,   
- *no* - Craig, 

**306** *Peter* - **PASSED**  
Point trading is allowed. That is, two players may (in private or public) come to some agreement of services in exchange for points at any time (not just on one of their turns). The transfer occurs when one of the parties involved has emailed the group stating the amount being sent from whom and to whom, and the second party involved seconding the procedure.  
[*This rule will be amended to allow confidential trading of points as soon as a framework to allow it has been finished and approved.*]  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**307** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
There exists a map called the 'gameboard.' An up to date version of the 'gameboard' shall be kept with the rest of the Wumpusland documentation. The 'gameboard' contains at least two completely distinct areas; one labeled "Start," and one labeled "Finish." When any player lands on the 'Finish' area, no further play is possible. That player gets another turn. No player may move on the 'gameboard' until the rules of such movement are further clarified in future rules.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**308** *Craig* - **PASSED**  
Repeal rule 204.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**309** *Shawn* - **PASSED**  
For a player to land on the start position of the game board they must
have a sufficient game piece that depicts a resemblance of them riding
a mythical creature.  To determine if this game piece is sufficient
anyone can call for a vote at any time by sharing their game piece
with everyone else in Wumpusland and a simple majority results in the
game piece being placed on the starting position.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* -  
- *abstain* - Andy, Norman,
  
**310** *Peter* - **FAILED**  
I propose that in order for a player to move on the gameboard, when/if such a process has been well-defined and regulated, it must occur on said person's turn, and will constitute the entirety of said person's turn.  
- *yes* - Peter,   
- *no* - Shawn, Richie, Craig, Andy, Norman,   
- *abstain* - 

**311** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
Positions on the gameboard are described by a 5-tuple of integers (positive or negative) - for example, (5,-1,4,0,0), (which for convenience can be written as a 3-tuple (5,1,4) when the last two numbers are both zero. The first 3 represent distance north of the origin, distance east of the origin, and height above the origin, each in units of wumplength. The fourth number represents time in the future ahead of the origin, in units of wumptime - where the origin is always at the current time. The fifth number represents distance from the origin along the wump axis, in units of wumpitude. The gameboard extends infinitely in all dimentions except for the 5th, in which it has a circular topology with (x,y,z,t,w) === (x,y,z,t,w modulo 3).  
The start area is centered at the origin (0,0,0,0,0) and the Wumpusland Warehouse where points can be exchanged for items is located at (2,10,0,0,0).  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig, Andy,   
- *no* -
