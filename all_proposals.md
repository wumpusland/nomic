All Proposals
=============

**301** *Shawn Bartok* - **PASSED**  
Immutable rules are now mutable except for rule 101. (this will allow us to change to majority voting instead of unanimous asap)  
- *yes* - Shawn, Richie, Peter, Craig  
- *no* -  

**302** *Peter* - **PASSED**  
A new proposal must be presented for discussion within 48 hours of the conclusion of the previous round; failure to do so will result in a 5-point penalty to the player whose turn it is, and the skipping of that player's turn.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**303** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
We define a 'quorum' to be the minimum number of 'eligible voters' required for an action on a rule change to be accepted. It will currently be set to 2/3rds of the number of 'eligible voters', rounded up. Once a proposal has been presented, quorum must be reached within 36 hours. At the end of this time period, if 'quorum' has been reached and not all 'eligible voters' have voted, action may be taken as if the 'eligible voters' making up the 'quorum' represented all 'eligible voters', and 'Eligible voters' not in the 'quorum' will be penalized 2 points. If 'quorum' is not reached, the rule change is considered 'tabled' - no points are awarded or subtracted, and the rule number does not increment, but that players turn is ended.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**304** *Craig* - **PASSED**  
Rule 209 (At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rule.) is repealed until rule 301 is no longer in effect.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**305** *Shawn* - **FAILED**  
In order for a rule change or new rule to be voted into existence it simply requires 2/3 majority with the person proposing the rule counting as a vote (instead of the previous 100% support).  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie,   
- *no* - Craig, 

**306** *Peter* - **PASSED**  
Point trading is allowed. That is, two players may (in private or public) come to some agreement of services in exchange for points at any time (not just on one of their turns). The transfer occurs when one of the parties involved has emailed the group stating the amount being sent from whom and to whom, and the second party involved seconding the procedure.  
[*This rule will be amended to allow confidential trading of points as soon as a framework to allow it has been finished and approved.*]  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**307** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
There exists a map called the 'gameboard.' An up to date version of the 'gameboard' shall be kept with the rest of the Wumpusland documentation. The 'gameboard' contains at least two completely distinct areas; one labeled "Start," and one labeled "Finish." When any player lands on the 'Finish' area, no further play is possible. That player gets another turn. No player may move on the 'gameboard' until the rules of such movement are further clarified in future rules.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**308** *Craig* - **PASSED**  
Repeal rule 204.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**309** *Shawn* - **PASSED**  
For a player to land on the start position of the game board they must
have a sufficient game piece that depicts a resemblance of them riding
a mythical creature.  To determine if this game piece is sufficient
anyone can call for a vote at any time by sharing their game piece
with everyone else in Wumpusland and a simple majority results in the
game piece being placed on the starting position.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* -  
- *abstain* - Andy, Norman,
  
**310** *Peter* - **FAILED**  
I propose that in order for a player to move on the gameboard, when/if such a process has been well-defined and regulated, it must occur on said person's turn, and will constitute the entirety of said person's turn.  
- *yes* - Peter,   
- *no* - Shawn, Richie, Craig, Andy, Norman,   
- *abstain* - 

**311** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
Positions on the gameboard are described by a 5-tuple of integers (positive or negative) - for example, (5,-1,4,0,0), (which for convenience can be written as a 3-tuple (5,1,4) when the last two numbers are both zero. The first 3 represent distance north of the origin, distance east of the origin, and height above the origin, each in units of wumplength. The fourth number represents time in the future ahead of the origin, in units of wumptime - where the origin is always at the current time. The fifth number represents distance from the origin along the wump axis, in units of wumpitude. The gameboard extends infinitely in all dimentions except for the 5th, in which it has a circular topology with (x,y,z,t,w) === (x,y,z,t,w modulo 3).  
The start area is centered at the origin (0,0,0,0,0) and the Wumpusland Warehouse where points can be exchanged for items is located at (2,10,0,0,0).

**312** *Craig* - **PASSED**  
The game state cannot be modified except in any way explicitly stated by the rules. The game state currently includes: the number of points any player has, the rules, proposals or votes, positions on the game board, items on the game board, winners and losers of the game, points trades, or any motion or action involving the game board. As any actions are defined which players may do to affect the game, those actions are implicitly added to the "game state" (eg, should players be allowed to give their pieces unique powers, those powers will now be part of the game state and must be used in ways that are explicitly stated by the rules. Or, if players are allowed to craft items from points, those crafting actions will affect game state and thus have to be explicitly allowed by rules) However, if an action is taken that does not affect the game state in any way, it is still allowed even if no rule explicitly states it. (eg, if there is a unanimous vote that pete smells bad, unless smelling bad affects the game state in some way, it would be allowed)

**313** *Andy* - **PASSED**  
The game board is envisioned as a physical space, and during play game pieces exist at a single point (x,y,z,t,w) on the board except while in transition from one location to another through a process yet to be defined. As in a physical space, such changes in frame require energy, or fuel. Fuel costs are proportional to the distance traveled, and  historical data indicate that unit price is proportional to the total amount of circulating currency [1]. Therefore, motion from one point on the board to another will cost a certain number of points determined by (a) distance from starting to ending point, and (b) the total number of points in play at the beginning of the turn.  
The travel distance is calculated as the spacetime interval between the starting point p1 (x1,y1,z1,t1,w1) and ending point p2 (x2,y2,z2,t2,w2), here using:
     s = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2 - (t2 - t1)^2 + (d(w1,w2))^2 ), 
where d(a,b) = displacement in the wump dimension.  
The cost c of travel is determined using s and the sum of all players' points, p:
     c = ceil( s * log_(phi) (s * gamma(p / 100 + phi) )
where ceil is the ceiling function, gamma is the (real) gamma function, the logarithm base is phi, and phi is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618.  
Points will be deducted at the completion of the turn involving the change of location. Players may not move to locations the motion to which would exceed in fuel costs their number of points. Fuel costs do not preclude the waging of other fees, taxes, etc., for travel to or from any location on the game board, or for any other reason.

Further members to Wumpusland must be approved by majority vote unless an exception applies.  All executions of exceptions must be reviewed by majority vote of Wumpusland members.  
Exception I. Proposed member is exempt if these conditions are met: (1) youtube video is posted of that proposed member eating a teaspoon of cinnamon (2) proposed member waxing of all pubic hair in the presence of a Jain (3) stealing of another Wupusland member's spoon.  
Exception II. Proposed member must have unanimous approval if that proposed member slept with a proposed member' friend's sister or a member's sister.

**315** *Shawn* - **PASSED**  
During your turn you may use a random number generator that gives a natural number with values ranging from 1 to 6. Your game piece teleports that many consecutive spaces along the game board from your location when you generated a random number when/if game spaces are defined.  Once using the random number generator it is not optional to teleport, but if multiple directions are possible you can choose which direction.  
To decide game spaces players may submit designs at any time so long as there is not currently a design being voted on.  Simple majority will result in the design being adopted.  Once an initial design has been accepted any future submissions must be given only during your turn (in addition to your rule) and the outcome of the vote on your rule will be the outcome of the amended game spaces.  
Keep in mind any submissions need to reflect the five dimensions that the board has already been ruled to have.
