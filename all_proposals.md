All Proposals
=============

**301** *Shawn Bartok* - **PASSED**  
Immutable rules are now mutable except for rule 101. (this will allow us to change to majority voting instead of unanimous asap)  
- *yes* - Shawn, Richie, Peter, Craig  
- *no* -  

**302** *Peter* - **PASSED**  
A new proposal must be presented for discussion within 48 hours of the conclusion of the previous round; failure to do so will result in a 5-point penalty to the player whose turn it is, and the skipping of that player's turn.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**303** *Richie* - **PASSED**  
We define a 'quorum' to be the minimum number of 'eligible voters' required for an action on a rule change to be accepted. It will currently be set to 2/3rds of the number of 'eligible voters', rounded up. Once a proposal has been presented, quorum must be reached within 36 hours. At the end of this time period, if 'quorum' has been reached and not all 'eligible voters' have voted, action may be taken as if the 'eligible voters' making up the 'quorum' represented all 'eligible voters', and 'Eligible voters' not in the 'quorum' will be penalized 2 points. If 'quorum' is not reached, the rule change is considered 'tabled' - no points are awarded or subtracted, and the rule number does not increment, but that players turn is ended.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**304** *Craig* - **PASSED**  
Rule 209 (At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rule.) is repealed until rule 301 is no longer in effect.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* - 

**305** *Shawn* - **FAILED**  
In order for a rule change or new rule to be voted into existence it simply requires 2/3 majority with the person proposing the rule counting as a vote (instead of the previous 100% support).  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie,   
- *no* - Craig,
