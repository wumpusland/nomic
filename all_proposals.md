All Proposals
=============

**301** *Shawn Bartok* - **PASSED**  
Immutable rules are now mutable except for rule 101. (this will allow us to change to majority voting instead of unanimous asap)  
- *yes* - Shawn, Richie, Peter, Craig  
- *no* -  

**302** *Peter* - **PASSED**  
A new proposal must be presented for discussion within 48 hours of the conclusion of the previous round; failure to do so will result in a 5-point penalty to the player whose turn it is, and the skipping of that player's turn.  
- *yes* - Shawn, Peter, Richie, Craig,   
- *no* -
